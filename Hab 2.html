      Violence is the intentional use of force or abuse of power to dominate someone or impose something. It can manifest itself through behaviors that involve:<br />
      Unmute<br />
      Physical force, to hurt, harm or kill someone<br />
      Verbal and gestural actions, to belittle or disqualify someone's idea or position<br />
      Inaction and silence, to despise someone.<br />
      Although the concept of violence is clear, the way it can manifest itself varies according to each culture. In addition, as humanity evolves, it is necessary to re-analyze the different modalities in which violence manifests itself from an ethical, moral or legal perspective.</span></p>
    <p class="textosinglish"><span class="textosinglish">This allows us to make visible aspects of daily life that result in violence and abuse, but which are not usually recognized as such because they are part of the customs of a given culture (for example, slavery was common and legal for hundreds of years until its abolition in the 19th century, first in Europe and then in the Americas).</span></p></td>

  <tr>
    <td height="751" align="left" valign="top" class="textosinglish"><p class="textosinglish">Physical violence. This is the most obvious form of violence or abuse, which can cause physical harm and put people at risk, although it does not always leave visible traces (for example, if someone pulls your hair or throws food in your face, that is an act of physical violence). It manifests itself in various ways such as corporal punishment, forced confinement, immobilization, etc.</p>
      <p>Psychological violence. This is one of the most difficult forms of violence to detect, which can cause psychological or emotional damage. It occurs when one or more people verbally and intentionally attack another person. Sometimes the aggression is not direct and obvious, but rather begins as something subtle and continues over time until it becomes a strong psychological aggression.</p>
      <p>Sexual violence. It is one of the forms of violence where the majority of the victims are women and the aggressors are men. It ranges from unwanted comments and insinuations to sexual acts. It manifests itself with aggressive acts through the use of physical, psychological or moral force that reduce the victim to conditions of inferiority to carry out sexual conduct against their will.</p>
    <p>Economic and patrimonial violence. It is one of the forms of violence that affects the victim's own assets and, if sustained over time, leads to other types of violence such as physical or sexual violence. It manifests itself with the transformation, theft, destruction or restriction of the victim's objects, documents, assets and valuables, preventing them from working or carrying out activities independently in order to control and threaten their integrity.</p>
    <p>Symbolic violence. It is one of the most hidden forms of violence that affects a large number of people simultaneously. It manifests itself indirectly in society, through strategies that impose stereotypes and mental structures, which are reinforced by repetition and end up being naturalized. For example, the socially adopted parameter of thinness and an almost unreal perfect body leads to severe psychological and physical disorders among the majority of the population that cannot achieve that appearance. </p></td>
